= How To Installing the plugin =

The easiest way to install the plugin is to get it from the XBMC add-on repository. Alternatively you can download the plugin manually and install it from a zip file here. 

For Linux, Mac OSX and Windows¶

Unpack the zip to a folder named plugin.video.youtube. This folder should be copied to your XBMC addons folder. 
•On linux it is found in $HOME/.xbmc/addons/ 
•On Mac it is found in /$User/Library/Application Support/XBMC/addons/ 
•On Windows 7 and Vista it is found in \media\windows\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\XBMC\addons\
